## Git vs. GitHub
[PICTURE HERE]

**_Git_** is defined as the system which is primarily used to give the user control of his versions _(Version Control)_. Specifically, git gives you the ability to **save changes of your file as previous versions over time**.  
> You can refer to your previous changes easily if you have a problem with your current project or want to use previous code in your project in order to improve it.  
> You can also remove these changes if you believe they are not needed in your history.

Github is a website used to post your projects and their previous versions for everyone to see. Similar to Git, you can refer back to your projects for the sake of improvement, removal, or fixing errors with your current file. However, the main difference between the two is that it is also used to **easily collaborate with one or more users on one or multiple projects**.
> Users go through a very short and easy process in order to collaborate with others, which would be taught later in the tutorial!  
> Collaborations are usually for adding suggested features or fixing bugs on one project, but they can be used for so much more!

## Initial Setup
###### Creating and setting up a github account is pretty straightforward, lets begin!

**Step One**: Locate github through the use of google or typing in the url of the website `https://github.com/` within the upper search bar of your browser. Here is the website: [_Github_](https://github.com/)  
* You have found the website successfully if you reached a site that looks like this:

* The main logo of github is a cat with a octupus arm, waving at the user (You!)
    * This symbol being present in the domain on your screen clearly means that you are within github

**Step Two**: Within the front page of github, you are presented with a white box that states for you to choose a *Username*, *Email (Can be either your **personal** email or **school** email)*, and a *Password (Must be greater than 7 and less than 15 characters for security reasons)*

> These are the requirements in order to create a github account, so start typing!
* Soon after fulfilling those requirements, your account will be automatically verified as a user and you will be given two plans, **Free** and **Developer**. They both have their own benefits, so choose

> Choosing the free plan has no consequences, so don't worry if you chose it  
    
* You will then be given to choose what projects you want to see based on your interests
    * It isn't very important, so you have the ability to skip it

* **You have successfully created an account, but you need to connect it to your cloud9 account (IF YOU HAVE ONE) to create and send your projects**
    
###### The process of connecting your github account to cloud9 is easier, so lets start!

**Step One**: Access the main page of cloud9 and log in with your github account.

**Step Two**: Press the _gear icon_ on the top right of the screen for a list of settings and press **_SSH Keys_**
>SSH Keys (**S**ecure **S**ocket S**h**ell) is a network protocol that gives you access to a remote (far-away / not present) location while having the ability to execute commands that modifies the remote area.
